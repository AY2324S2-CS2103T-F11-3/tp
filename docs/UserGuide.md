# TalentTracker User Guide

TalentTracker is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, TalentTracker can get your hiring management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `talenttracker.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TalentTracker.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar talenttracker.jar`
   command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

2. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>


* Parameters must be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `<name>, <email>,<phone number>`, they must be typed in that order.

* Commands are case-insensitive.<br>
 e.g if the user types `ADD INTERVIEW`, it is interpreted as `add interview`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
